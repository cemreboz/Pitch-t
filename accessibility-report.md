## Demographic Considerations
Certain demographics may find our program less accessible, particularly:
- Those with limited digital literacy or access to modern devices or the internet.
- Users with visual impairments, if features like screen reader compatibility are not fully implemented.
- People with dexterity disabilities, who might struggle with typing verbose business idea descriptions.
